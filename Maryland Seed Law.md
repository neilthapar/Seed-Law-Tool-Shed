# Maryland Seed Law

Location: [Title 15, Subtitle 8 - Turf and Seed](http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/subtitle_chapters/15_Chapters.aspx#Subtitle08)

**Section 15.08.01.02**

"Any agricultural, vegetable, flower, tree, shrub, or lawn and turf seed which is **sold**, **transported**, **offered for sale**, or **exposed for sale** within the State of Maryland is subject to Regulations .03-----.13 of this chapter."

[2012 Press Release](http://news.maryland.gov/mda/press-release/2012/09/25/maryland-agriculture-turf-and-seed-section-celebrates-100-years-of-service/) from the Maryland Department of Agriculture celebrating the seed law states: 

*   "The Maryland Seed Law requires all seed **offered for sale** in the state to be accurately labeled."
*   "Our highly trained staff takes tremendous pride in ensuring that all turfgrass and seed **offered for sale** in Maryland are of the highest quality through certification and regulatory activities.‚Äù

**Comments**

*   It seems clear from the definition above that only entities that engage in seed sales would be subject to this law. Any action taken to subject a seed library to this law would require a showing that the library was "transporting" seeds. Seed libraries would probably have to make sure that people brought the seeds to them, so mobile seed libraries might be a problem. Of course, technically the individuals transporting the seed to and from the seed libraries might come within the definition above, but it is doubtful that regulators would require private individuals driving to and from the local seed library to register with the state.

**Questions**

1.  Are there any seed regulations pursuant to this statute?
2.  Are there any other laws that might regulate the exchange or transfer of seeds in Maryland?
