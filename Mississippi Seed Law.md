# Mississippi Seed Law

**Summary: Seed libraries should not be considered "seedsmen" requiring a permit under this law because they are not selling, offering for sale or exchanging seeds. The state might argue that they are seedsman because ยง 69-3-3 uses the word "distributing." They might also argue that the seed libraries are "exchanging" seeds. **

**ยง 69-3-1. Definitions **

**(a) "Advertisement" **means all representations made by the labeler, other than those on the label, disseminated in any manner or by any means, relating to seed within the scope of this article.

**(b) "Agricultural seeds" **means the seed of grass, forage, cereal and fiber crops, lawn seed, and any other kinds of seed, including transgenic seeds, recognized within this state as agricultural or field seeds, and mixtures of such seeds.

**(e) "Commercial grower" **means a person, firm or corporation engaged primarily in the production of seed for planting purposes for sale or trade.

**(h) "Consumer" **means any person who purchases or otherwise obtains seed for sowing but not for resale.

**(n) "Flower seed" **means the seeds of herbaceous plants grown for their blooms, ornamental foliage or other ornamental parts, including transgenic seeds, and commonly known and sold under the name of flower seeds in this state.

**(z) "Prohibited noxious weed seed" **means the seeds of weeds that reproduce by seed, and/or spread by underground roots or stems, and which, when established, are highly destructive and difficult to control in this state by ordinary good cultural practice, or constitute a peculiar hazard to the agriculture of this state.

**(dd) "Seed record"** means information which relates to the origin, treatment, germination and purity of each lot of agricultural seed sold, offered or exposed for sale in this state, or which relates to the treatment, germination and variety of each lot of vegetable, flower, or tree and shrub seed sold, offered or exposed for sale in this state. Such information includes seed samples and records of declarations, labels, purchases, sales, cleaning, bulking, handling, storage, analyses, tests and examinations.

**(nn) "Weed seed" **means the seeds, bulblets or tubers of all plants generally recognized as weeds within the state and includes noxious weed seeds.

*   **Note: a seed library might be considered a "seedsman" because there is "exchange" of seeds. (Which is not defined in the seed law). They could be exempt because they are not selling the seeds.**

**ยง 69-3-3. Seedsman permits **

(1) Every seedsman who sells, offers for sale, exposes for sale, **<u>distributes </u>**or solicits orders for the sale of any agricultural seed or mixtures thereof, vegetable seed, flower seed, or tree and shrub seed as defined in Section 69-3-1 to farmers, retail seed dealers, wholesale distributors, **_or to others who use or plant such seed in the State of Mississippi,_** shall, before selling or offering such seed for sale or distributing or soliciting orders for the sale of such seed and on or before the first day of July of each year, secure an annual permit from the commissioner to engage in such business. Seed dealers and other sellers of seed shall apply for an annual permit upon forms prescribed by the commissioner and such a permit shall be issued upon the payment of the following permit fees when the application is in proper form:

(a) Each seedsman selling packet seed, in closed containers of less than four (4) ounces, through commission merchants or agents, shall furnish each agent with permit at fee of Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($ 2.50) per agent. A separate permit shall be required for each location or place of business with rack display.

(b) For each seedsman engaged in selling vegetable seed at retail from containers of four (4) ounces or more, not displayed on a rack, a permit fee of Five Dollars ($ 5.00) for each such place of business. This permit will qualify the seedsman to only sell vegetable seeds, as identified by the Federal Seed Act, directly to the consumer.

(c) For each seedsman engaged in selling seed at retail to the consumer, except vegetable seed dealers as defined above and packet seed agents, a permit fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($ 25.00) for each such place of business. This permit will qualify the seedsman to only sell seed to the consumer for sowing but not for resale.

(d) For each seedsman engaged in selling seed to wholesale distributors only, a permit fee of Five Dollars ($ 5.00) for each such place of business of the seller. This permit will qualify the seedsman to sell only to "wholesale distributors."

(e) For each seedsman engaged in selling seed as a wholesale distributor, a permit fee of One Hundred Dollars ($ 100.00) for each such place of business. This permit qualifies a seedsman to sell at levels for permits required by paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section.

(2) Out-of-state seedsmen who sell or ship seed into this state shall obtain a permit in the same manner as described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section.

(3) For the purpose of enforcement of the permit provisions of this section, the type of permit held by the buyer shall determine the type of permit required of the seller.

(4) Permits shall be renewed annually, beginning July 1, and may be revoked for cause by the commissioner. Failure to renew such permit by September 1 of each year will incur a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) to the cost of the permit. The initial registration will be at the prescribed fee. However, the fee for first time permit applicants received on or after April 1 will be prorated by the commissioner for all classifications except packet agent permits.

(5) The Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station shall be exempt from permit requirements for seed distributed for increase.

*   **Note: if they are not a "seedsman" under the definition (not selling or exchanging) then they could be exempt from the permit requirement, even if they are "distributing" seed.**
*   **The Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station is exempt. The seed libraries should be treated in the same way because seed libraries don't exist for profit, but to support the health and well-being of their communities.**

**ยง 69-3-6. Seed inspection fees **

(1) The department may establish seed inspection fees, prescribe and furnish forms, and require the filing of reports necessary for the payment of the inspection fees. The department may inspect the record of any seedsman during the normal hours of business operation as it deems necessary.

(2) All fees collected under this section shall be deposited into a special fund in the State Treasury. The department may expend the monies in the fund by an annual appropriation approved by the Legislature for the support of the Seed Division of the Bureau of Plant Industry.

(3) Every seedsman who sells or distributes seed for sale, whether in bulk or in containers, within or into Mississippi for planting purposes, shall be assessed a seed inspection fee as required by the department.

(4) Every seedsman must:

   (a) Pay an inspection fee on the total number of pounds of seed sold or otherwise distributed for sale within or into the state. Payment of the seed inspection fees shall be the responsibility of the seedsman initiating the first sale of seed within or into the state;

   (b) Maintain records, as required by the department, that accurately reflect the total pounds of seed subject to the fees that are handled, sold or offered, or distributed for sale;

   (c) File quarterly reports on forms provided or approved by the department, covering the total pounds of all sales of seed subject to the fee and sold during the preceding quarter. The reports and fees due shall be filed with the department no later than thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar quarter.

(5) A seedsman who does not file the quarterly report by the due date shall pay a penalty fee as provided by the regulations of the department. The penalty fee shall be waived if the seedsman obtains prior written approval from the department for a late filing and complies with the late filing requirements.

(6) If a seedsman does not comply with all the requirements of this section, the commissioner may suspend the seedsman's permit until the seedsman is in compliance.

*   **Note: seed libraries should not be required to under go the testing, recording or reporting requirements here. They are too burdensome.**

**ยง 69-3-5. Labeling requirements **
