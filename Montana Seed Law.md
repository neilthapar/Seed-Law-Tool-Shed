**80-5-130. Licensing -- application -- fee. **

(1) All facilities located in the state that condition agricultural seed shall obtain a license from the department for each facility. However, a seed grower, when conditioning only seed from that grower's own production, is not required to be licensed under this part.

The following persons, however, are excluded from the licensing requirements under this subsection: 

     (a) a Montana certified seed grower when labeling certified seed from that grower's own production; 

     (b) any person who updates germination test data by affixing to the package of seed a supplemental label bearing new germination data, the lot number, and the person's name and address; or 

     (c) a Montana grower who labels seed only of that labeler's own production with a gross annual sales value of $5,000 or less. 

     (4) A person who sells agricultural seed in Montana shall obtain a seed dealer's license from the department for each place where seed is located or sold, except for:

     (5) (a) Except as provided in this subsection (5), the fee is $55 a year for each type of license. The department may by rule adjust the license fee by type of license to maintain adequate funding for the administration of this part. The fee may not be less than $55 a year or more than $75 a year. 

     (b) Except as provided in this subsection (5)(b), the license fee for an out-of-state person selling seed in Montana is $110 a year. 

**80-5-136. Administration -- stop sale order -- violation -- cancellation of license -- enforcement. **

     (1) The department shall administer and enforce the provisions of this part and the rules promulgated under this part. 

     (2) The department may issue and enforce a written or printed stop sale order to the owner or custodian of any lot of seed that the department finds to be in violation of this chapter. The order shall prohibit further sale or movement of the seed until the department has evidence that this chapter has been complied with. Upon proper correction by reconditioning, labeling, or otherwise and when in the judgment of the department the requirements of this chapter have been met, the stop sale order must be lifted and the seed may be sold. If a violation cannot be corrected after adequate opportunity has been provided, the department may order the destruction of any lot of seed remaining in violation. An order for the destruction of a lot of seed is subject to the contested case provisions of Title 2, chapter 4, part 6. 

     (3) Distribution of seeds that are not legally labeled or failure to comply with this chapter or rules issued under its authority constitutes sufficient grounds for the department to cancel or deny a license to a licensee, provided that the licensee is given a reasonable opportunity to correct inadvertent and nonrecurring deficiencies. 

     (4) A person who violates or aids in the violation of any provision of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter is subject to one or both of the following penalties: 

     (a) an administrative civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each offense. Assessment of a penalty under this subsection (4)(a) may be made in conjunction with any other warning, order, or administrative action by the department under the authority of this part. 

     (b) a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $100 or more than $300 plus costs of prosecution for the first violation and not less than $500 or more than $1,000 plus costs of prosecution for each subsequent violation.
