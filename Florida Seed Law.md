**NOTES:**

Florida's seed law applies only to the sale, offer for sale, distribution for sale, exposure for sale, handling for sale, or soliciting for purchase of seeds. As long as a seed library is not doing any of these things, they should be fine.

In Florida, like in almost every other state, however, there is no express exemption for nonprofit, cooperative, or government-run seed libraries.
