**Location of Seed Law:**

At least one law is at Texas Administrative Code, Title 4, Part 1, Chapter 9 - Seed Quality

[RULE §9.3](http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=4&pt=1&ch=9&rl=3)** - Vegetable Seed**

(a) A person may not **sell, offer, expose, or otherwise distribute for sale** vegetable seed for planting purposes in this state unless such person first obtains a Vegetable Seed License from the department.

[RULE §9.2 ](http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=4&pt=1&ch=9&rl=2)**- Agricultural Seed**

any person who sells, offers, exposes, or otherwise distributes for sale agricultural seed within this state for planting purposes shall pay an inspection fee

[Texas Seed and Plant Certification Act (and regulations)](http://www.turnerseed.com/seedcatalog/wildlife/images/cert_RR_Sept2008.pdf)

Comment: seems this section is full of regulations for certified seeds and seems Texas is a center of certified seed, CA, NE, IA don't have such extensive rules as far as i can see if that is any indication. Also more universities involved in certification and regulatory bodies than other above mentioned states.
