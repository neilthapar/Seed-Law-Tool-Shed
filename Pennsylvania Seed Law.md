# Pennsylvania Seed Law

[Text of the Pennsylvania Seed Act](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/uconsCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&yr=2004&sessInd=0&smthLwInd=0&act=0164.)

In Pennsylvania, supplying seed might make you subject to the requirement to get a license, which involves filling out a form and paying an annual $25 fee (Section <u>[7103](https://govt.westlaw.com/pac/Document/NFAFD9570342811DA8A989F4EECDB8638?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default))</u>, Chapter 71 of PA Consolidated Statutes). However, the sections of the law (<u>[7104,](https://govt.westlaw.com/pac/Document/NFA22ECE0342811DA8A989F4EECDB8638?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default))</u> <u>[7105](https://govt.westlaw.com/pac/Document/NFA39D040342811DA8A989F4EECDB8638?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default))</u>, etc.) that mandate testing and labeling only apply if you sell seed. Not “supply,” but “sell!”  See below.

**From Section 7102. Definitions**

*   **"Distribution."**  The importing, consigning, offering for sale, selling, bartering or otherwise supplying seed in this Commonwealth.
*   **"Distributor."**  The person whose name appears on the label of seed.  

_COMMENT: Does that mean that if you don't put your name on the label, then you aren't a distributor?_

**From 7103. Licensing.**

*   **(a) General rule.--**Every person functioning as a **distributor** of seed in this Commonwealth shall, on or before January 1 of each year or prior to distribution, apply for and obtain an annual license for each legal entity. Each distributor shall complete a form furnished by the department and pay a $25 application fee. All licenses shall expire on December 31 of each year.

_QUESTION: Has anyone filled out this form?  What does it ask? _

**From 7104. Labels and labeling.**

*   **(a) General rule.--**It shall be **unlawful to sell, offer for sale, expose for sale or transport** any seed subject to the provisions of this chapter for seeding purposes in bulk, packages or containers unless the package or container in which the same shall be exposed or offered for sale or transported shall have attached thereto, in a conspicuous place on the exterior thereof, a tag or label on which shall be plainly and legibly written or printed in English the following information relating to the seed:  [and then it goes on with a long list of requirements]

_COMMENT: The labeling requirements only apply to selling. Seed libraries aren't selling seeds!!_

**Introduction to The Seed Program of the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.**

*   "The seed regulatory program protects the industry and consumers through inspection and analysis of seed products in the marketplace."  

_COMMENT:  Introductions to laws are often used to clarify the context of the statute and its intentions.  A library is not an industry or marketplace and library users are not consumers.  Even according to the Oxford English Dictionary, a consumer is "a person who purchases goods and services for personal use."  _

**From Section 7102. Definitions**

*   **“Stop-sale.”** The term includes any written or printed notices given or issued by the Secretary of Agriculture or his agent to the owner or custodian of any lot of seeds in this Commonwealth directing such owner or custodian not to sell, offer or expose for sale or move such seeds within or out of this Commonwealth until the requirements of this chapter, and the regulations promulgated under authority of this chapter, shall have been complied with and a written release has been issued.

_COMMENT:  This definition lends further evidence to the interpretation that the Pennsylvania law was never meant to regulate seeds that are not being sold.  The act contains no provision for "Stop-exchanging"._

**Notes from Leslie Goldman**

*   Working Toward a National Protocol and Changing the Seed Laws as Well
*   My Research shows that it is possible for Seed Libraries in Public Libraries in Pennsylvania to do seed swaps and organize themselves as independent Seed Libraries with Seed Banks without being in violation of the Pennsylvania seed law.  I want to invite all to participate in this discussion on the seed library social network site.
*   Here is a recent email from Johnny Zook, the Seed Program Supervisor.  I have found him helpful and well meaning.

_Subject: RE: Suggested Draft for an additional Protocol and Procedure for adding protocols. Please comment, Johnny._

_To: Leslie Goldman_

_Hi Leslie,_

_However, the protocols get worked out is not so much the issue, but rather does an action(s) cause the activity to be classified as “Seed Distribution”. As long as we can have a logical/reasonable way to say the activity is not seed distribution, then its fine to operate without concern of the Seed Act – speaking for Pennsylvania. Also, in PA, once the Seed Library is big enough it could function within the Seed Act. $25.00 for seed license fee and $7.00 for each 400 seed Germination test would be the ‘cost’; and, not that printing is hard, the seed label can be hand written as long as it is legible._

_I am willing to take suggestions, and if you know people have ideas it would be good for me to have them sooner than later._
