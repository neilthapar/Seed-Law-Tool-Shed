# Recommended Uniform State Seed Law

The Association of American Seed Control Officials (AASCO) is a national membership organization comprised of state seed regulatory officials. Among other activities, AASCO developed and maintains the <u>[Revised Uniform State Seed Law](http://www.seedcontrol.org/pdf/russl_2013.pdf)</u>, the model law that many states’ seed laws are based on. 

**SECTION 2. Label requirements for agricultural, vegetable, and flower seeds. **

"Each container of agricultural, vegetable, and flower seeds which is **sold, offered for sale, or exposed for sale, or transported **within this State for sowing purposes shall bear thereon or have attached thereto in a conspicuous place a plainly written or printed label or tag in the English language, giving the following information, which statement shall not be modified or denied in the labeling or on another label attached to the container [...]"

*   **NOTE: While this language seems to apply only to sales, the reference to "transported" is unclear and may infringe on some of the activities of seed sharers who move seeds from one place to another in order to share them (i.e. driving with seeds to a seed swap). This should be revised to be clear that the labeling requirement only applies in commercial transactions.**

**SECTION 3. Prohibition. **

"(a) It is unlawful for any person to **sell, offer for sale, expose for sale, or transport for sale **any agricultural, 

vegetable, flower or tree and shrub seeds within this State – [...].

*   **NOTE: The uniform law does not refer to barter, trade, supply, or exchange of seeds. Language refers only to selling and transporting of seed.**
