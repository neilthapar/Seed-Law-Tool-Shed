[Text of the New Mexico Seed Law](http://www.nmda.nmsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/nmseedlaw.pdf)

_________________________________________________________________________________

Summary:

This law does not define what "sold, offered for sale, or exposed for sale, or transported within this state for sowing purposes" means. It could be that "transported within this state for sowing purposes" includes seeds in seed libraries because they are often transported to the library and are intended for sowing purposes. However, it's unclear if seed libraries fall under the scope of this legislation.

**76-10-12. Definitions. **

B. "agricultural seeds" includes the seeds of grass, forage, cereal and fiber crops. It shall include any other kinds of seeds commonly recognized within this state as agricultural seeds, lawn seeds and mixtures of such seeds, and may include noxious weed seeds when the board of regents of New Mexico state university determines that such seed is being used as agricultural seed;

C. "vegetable seeds" includes the seeds of those crops which are grown in gardens and on truck farms and are generally known and sold under the name of vegetable seeds in this state;\

**76-10-13. Label requirements. **

Each container of agricultural or vegetable seed which is sold, offered for sale, or exposed for sale, or transported within this state for sowing purposes shall bear thereon or have attached thereto in a conspicuous place a plainly written or printed label or tag in the English language, giving the following information, which statement shall not be modified or denied in the labeling or on another label attached to the container. 

D. For vegetable seeds in containers of one [1] pound or less: 
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>(1) name of kind and variety of seed; </li>
<li>(2) for seeds which germinate less than the standard last established by the board under this act: 

*   (a) percentage of germination, exclusive of hard seed; 
*   (b) percentage of hard seed, if present; 
*   (c) the calendar month and year the test was completed to determine such percentages; and 
*   (d) the words "Below Standard" in not less than 8 point type; and 
</ul style="list-style: none;">

*   (3) name and address of the person who labeled said seed, or who sells, offers, or exposes said seed for sale within this state. 

E. For vegetable seeds in containers of more than one [1] pound: 

*   (1) the name of each kind and variety present in excess of five per cent [5%] and the percentage by weight of each in order of its predominance. 
*   (2) lot number or other lot identification; 

Following subparagraphs (a) and (b) the "total germination and hard seed" may be stated as such, if desired; 

*   (4) name and address of the person who labeled said seed, or who sells, offers or exposes said seed for sale within this state; and 
*   (5) the labeling requirements for vegetable seeds in containers of more than one [1] pound shall be deemed to have been met if the seed is weighed from a properly labeled container in the presence of the purchaser. 

**Note:** _If seeds from seed libraries fall under the statute, this may require additional administrative requirements such as testing for germination rates and labeling according to the requirements set forth in this section._

**76-10-14. Prohibitions. **

A. It is unlawful for any person to sell, offer for sale, expose for sale or to transport for sale any agricultural or vegetable seed within this state: 

*   1) unless the test to determine the percentage of germination required by section 2 [76-10-12] shall have been completed within a nine month period, exclusive of the calendar month in which the test was completed, immediately prior to sale, exposure for sale, or offering for sale or transportation; provided, the board may set a different period if after hearing it is found advisable to do so; 
*   (2) not labeled in accordance with the provisions of this act [76-10-11 to 76-10-22], or having a false or misleading labeling; 

**Note:** _This section underscores the importance of following the labeling requirements, though it is unclear if the requirements apply to seed offered for free through seed libraries._

**76-10-15. Records.**

Each person whose name appears on the label as handling agricultural or vegetable seed subject to this act [76-10-11 to 76-10-22] shall keep for a period of two (2) years complete records of each lot of agricultural or vegetable seed handled and keep for one (1) year a file sample of each lot of seed after final disposition of said lot. All such records and samples pertaining to the shipment or shipments involved shall be accessible for inspection by the board or its agents during customary business hours. 

**Notes:** _The applicability of this section likely turns on whether seed libraries are required to label their seed. _

**76-10-16. Exemptions.** 

A. The provisions of sections 3 and 4 [76-10-13, 76-10-14] do not apply: 

*   (1) to seed or grain not intended for sowing purposes; 
*   (2) to seed in storage in, or being transported or consigned to, a cleaning or processing establishment for cleaning or processing; Provided, that the invoice or labeling accompanying any shipment of said seed bears the statement "seed for processing" and Provided that any labeling or other representation which may be made with respect to the uncleaned or unprocessed seed shall be subject to this act; and 
*   (3) to any carrier in respect to any seed transported or delivered for transportation in the ordinary course of its business as a carrier; Provided, that such carrier is not engaged in producing, processing, or marketing agricultural or vegetable seeds subject to the provisions of this act and 
*   (4) to seed or grain sold by the grower on his farm as uncleaned, untested and unprocessed. 

**Note:**_ It does not appear any of these exceptions apply to seed libraries. _
