# Arkansas Seed Law

[Text of the Arkansas Seed Rules](http://plantboard.arkansas.gov/Seed/Documents/CIR%2010%20-%20JUNE%202014.pdf)

## Summary

The Arkansas Seed Law is located in Arkansas Annotated Codes Title 2, Subtitle 2, Chapter 18 and authorizes the State Plant Board to make all rules and regulations necessary to carry out the purpose of the law, which is to "provide supplies of high-grade seed, true to name and free from disease, for planting purposes."

From the Arkansas State Plant Board's website describing the purpose of the state's seed program: "**The ultimate purpose of seed laws and regulations is to protect the consumer from poor quality or mislabeled planting seed and to provide a level opportunity for the selling of seed.**"

The law requires that anyone who distributes seed must get a license, which might be interpreted broadly to include seed libraries. The law also might require that seed libraries and seed sharers label the seeds they distribute.

Licenses shall be issued on an annual basis covering the period July 1 through June 30. Applications for securing a license may be obtained from the State Plant Board.
