# Vermont Seed Law

V.S.A. Title 6 Chapter 35

[Text of the Vermont Seed Law](http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/fullchapter/06/035)

______________________________________________________________________

**Summary: **The Vermont seed law only regulates seed that is "sold" in the state. Unfortunately, the statute does not elaborate on the definition of "sold." As seen in the seed laws of other states, this term can include "exchanges" where no money changes hands. It is unclear how Vermont defines the word "sold." The statute should clarify what exactly "sold" means, and exempt seed libraries if they do in fact come under the law's scope.

**ยง 641. Definitions**

(1) "Agricultural seed" includes grass, forage, cereal, oil, fiber, and other kinds of crop seeds commonly recognized as agricultural seeds, lawn seeds, and combinations of such seeds, and may include noxious weed seeds used as agricultural seed.

(4) "Flower seed" includes seed of herbaceous plants grown for their blooms, ornamental foliage, or other ornamental parts, and commonly known and sold under the name of flower seed.

(7) "Vegetable seeds" include the seeds of those crops which are grown in gardens and on truck farms and are generally known and sold under the name of vegetable or herb seeds in this state.

**Note:** _This section does not include a definition of the word "sold." It will be crucial to understand the definition of this word in the statute to understand its applicability to seed libraries._

**ยง 643. Enforcement**

(a) To enforce the provisions of this subchapter, the secretary, upon presenting appropriate credentials, may:

*   (1) enter upon any premises where seeds are processed, packed, or held for distribution, during regular business hours, in order to have access to seeds and associated records subject to this subchapter, and inspect any truck or other conveyor by land, water, or air, at any time when the conveyor is accessible, for the same purpose;
*   (2) issue and enforce a written or printed "stop sale" order to the owner or custodian of any lot of seed subject to the provisions of this subchapter which the secretary finds is in violation of any of the provisions of this subchapter. The order shall prohibit further sale, processing, and movement of the seed, except on approval of the secretary, until the secretary has issued a release from the "stop sale" order of the seed. The owner or custodian of seed for which a "stop sale" has been issued shall have the right to request a hearing in writing before the secretary within 15 days of the issuance of the order.

**Note:** _This subchapter gives the government broad latitude to inspect premises "where seeds are processed, packed, or held for distribution" for violations of the statute and take action when violations are stop further sale of the seed. It is not clear if this applies to seed libraries where there is no exchange of money for seed._

**ยง 644. Label requirements for agricultural, flower, and vegetable seeds**

(a) Each container of agricultural, flower, and vegetable seeds which is sold in this state for sowing purposes shall be labeled.

**ยง 646. Exemptions**

(a) The provisions of sections 644, 645, and 647 of this title shall not apply:

*   (1) to seed or grain not intended for sowing purposes;
*   (2) to seed in storage in, or being transported or consigned to, a cleaning or processing establishment for cleaning or processing, provided that the invoice or labeling accompanying any shipment of such seed bears the statement "seeds for processing." Any labeling or other representation which may be made with respect to the uncleaned or unprocessed seed shall be subject to section 644 of this title;
*   (3) to any carrier of seed transported or delivered for transportation in the ordinary course of its business as a carrier; provided that such carrier is not engaged in producing, processing, or marketing seeds subject to the provisions of this subchapter.

**Note: **_There is no explicit exemption for seed libraries._
