# Louisiana Seed Law

**Summary: The permit is required whenever seeds are "distributed" -- triggering regulation of seed libraries. **

**The label requirements are only for seeds offered for sale. **

**The testing requirements apply to any seed being "distributed," which would trigger seed library compliance.**

**ยง1431.  Terms defined**

As used in this Part, the following terms have the meanings given:

(1)  **"Advertisement" **means all representations, other than those on the label, disseminated in any manner or by any means, relating to seed within the scope of this  Part.

(2) ** "Agricultural seed" **means any lawn, flower, oil, grass, forage, cereal, fiber, or other kinds of crop seed sold, offered for sale, or used in Louisiana for agricultural or other purposes, and any combinations of such seeds.

(8) ** "Farm" **means a piece or tract of land on which an agricultural, vegetable, or flower crop is grown or allowed to grow.

(9) ** "Flower seeds" **are seeds of all plants grown for ornamental purposes for domestic or commercial use.

(15)** "Labeling" **includes all labels and other written, printed, or graphic representations accompanying and pertaining to any seed, whether in bulk or containers.  Labeling includes invoices and other bills of shipment when sold in bulk.  The labels shall be uniform in accordance with the standards adopted by the Association of Southern Seed Control Officials.

(17)**  "Minor violation" **means a violation of noncompliance that does not create a competitive disadvantage for licensees in full compliance, is not a violation that adversely affects human health, safety or the environment, is not a violation performed with malicious, deliberate or fraudulent intent, and is not a repetitive violation.

(22)**  "Person" **means any individual, firm, corporation, association, or partnership.

(25)**  "Retail seedsman" **means any person who **sells seed at retail directly to the consumer **either in quantities of not less than one pound or any quantity including closed containers of less than one pound.

(26)**  "Seed" **is a propagative part of a plant capable of producing a new plant, including but not limited to those parts commonly referred to as seeds, bulbs, roots, tubers, and other propagating stock.

*   **Note: any violation of Louisiana Law by a seed library, considering it's scope of activities, would likely be considered a "minor violation."**
