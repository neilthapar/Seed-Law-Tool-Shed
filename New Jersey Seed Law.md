# New Jersey Seed Law

[Text of the New Jersey State Seed Law](http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/pi/pdf/seedlaw.pdf) | [Text of the New Jersey Seed Rules](http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/pi/pdf/njac221.pdf)

**Summary:** **The New Jersey seed law regulates seeds that are "sold" in the state. However, the statute does not clearly define the words "sold" or "sell." From seed laws of other states, these terms can include "exchanges" where no money changes hands. The statute should clarify what exactly "sold" means and exempt seed libraries if they do in fact come under the law's scope.**

**New Jersey Seed Rules**

(The New Jersey "Seed Rules," as opposed to the "Seed Law," are rules promulgated by the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law [OAL]. The OAL implements the Administrative Procedure Act, _N.J.S.A._ 52:14B-1_ et seq._, advising executive branch agencies on how to make rules and requiring the agencies to follow statutorily prescribed steps in rule-making. **<u>Further, it must ensure that the formulation of rules includes adequate opportunity for input by anyone interested and affected</u>.**)

**2:21-1.1  Seed for planting purposes**

Seeds **<u>offered for sale or exposed for sale, or transported in the State</u>**, when the vendor either orally, in writing, or in advertising implies that such goods are "suitable for seed," "fit for seed," or similar terms**<u> shall be deemed to be offered for sale for planting purposes.</u>**

**Note: While the definitions in this section refer to seeds offered for sale for planting purposes, the term "sale" and the phrase "exposed for sale" are not clearly defined. These terms may include activities of seed libraries. The rules should specifically define these terms and expressly excuse seed libraries. **

**New Jersey State Seed Law**

**4:8-17.13. Definitions   **

*   **Note: This section does not define the word "sell" or "sold". Therefore, it is unclear whether seed sharing or giving would be covered by the states seed law. **
*   **                                       **

(d) The term "agricultural seeds" means and includes the seeds of grass, forage, cereal and fiber crops and any other kinds of seeds, commonly recognized within this State as agricultural seeds, lawn seeds and mixtures of such seeds, and may include noxious weed seeds when the State Seed Analyst determines that such seed is being used as agricultural seed.                                                  

(e) The term "vegetable seed" means and includes the seeds of those crops which are grown in gardens and on truck farms and **<u>are generally known and sold</u>** under the name of vegetables or herbs in this State.                                        

** 4:8-17.15. Labels**

Each container of agricultural, vegetable, flower, tree and shrub seeds <u>which is sold</u>, **<u>offered for sale</u>, or <u>exposed for sale</u>, or <u>transported within this State for sowing purposes</u> **shall bear thereon or have attached thereto or in a conspicuous place on the exterior of the container a plainly written or printed label or tag in the English language, in legible type or in script specifying:

*   (g) If any labeling, advertising, or other representations subject to this act represents the seed to be certified or registered seed unless it has been determined by a seed certifying agency that such seed was produced, processed and packaged, and conforms to standards of purity as to kind or variety, in compliance with rules and regulations of such agency pertaining to such seed, and the seed bears an official label issued for such seed by a seed certifying agency stating that the seed is of a specified class and a specified kind, species and subspecies, if appropriate, or variety.                                              
*   (h) Represented to be hybrid unless such seed conforms to the definition of hybrid in section 1(q) of this act; provided that this prohibition shall not apply to variety names in common trade usage at the time this act becomes effective.                                                  
*   (i) Labeled with a variety name but not certified by a certifying agency and the variety of seed has a certificate of plant variety protection issued by the Plant Variety Protection Office in the United States Department of Agriculture under the "Plant Variety Protection Act," Pub.L. 91-577 (7 U.S.C. s. 2321 et seq.) which certificate specifies sale only as a class of certified seed, provided that seed from a certified lot may be labeled as to variety name when used in a mixture by, or with the approval of, the owner of the variety.  

**4:8-17.17. Other unlawful acts **

No person within this State shall -- 

*   (a) Detach, alter, deface, or destroy any label provided for in this act or the rules and regulations made and promulgated thereunder, or alter or substitute seed in a manner that may defeat the purpose of this act.                                            
*   (b) Disseminate any false or misleading advertisements concerning seed in any manner or by any means. 
*   (c) Hinder or obstruct in any way, any authorized person in the performance of his duties under this act.                                               
*   (d) Fail to comply with a "**<u>stop sale</u>**" order or to move or otherwise handle or dispose of any lot of seed held under a "**<u>stop</u>**<u> **sale</u>**" order or tags attached thereto except with express permission of the State Seed Analyst, and for the purpose specified thereby. 
*   (e) Use the word "type" in any labeling in connection with the name of any agricultural seed variety.

**Note: Since "sell" or "sale" is not defined, there is no way of knowing whether a stop sale applies to seed libraries. **
