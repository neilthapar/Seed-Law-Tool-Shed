# Missouri Seed Law

[Text of Missouri State Seed Law](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000111.html) (Aug. 2014)

Missouri Revised Statutes §§ 266.011–266.111.

## Summary

**WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS LAW!** The Missouri Seed Law does not define "sell" or "for sale," leaving seed libraries' legal obligations unclear. Even if Missouri clearly defined these terms to exclude seed libraries, still more burdensome permitting, labeling, and testing requirements might apply to seed libraries. We need to change this law to make Missouri seed libraries' legal status clear and prevent possible seizure and fines for failure to meet unnecessarily burdensome requirements intended for commercial activities. 

**266.021 Definitions**

*   **(2)** "Agricultural seeds" includes the seeds of grass, forage, cereal and fiber crops and any other kinds of seeds commonly recognized within this state as agricultural or field seeds, except Johnson grass.
*   **(3)** "Certified seed" means certified, registered, foundation or any term conveying a similar meaning when referring to seed that has been produced, processed and labeled in accordance with the procedures and in compliance with the rules and regulations of a legally constituted and officially recognized seed certifying agency as provided for in this law.
*   **(9)** "Label" means any tag, label, brand, or device attached to, or written, stamped, printed, or stenciled on any container of seed or supplied with any bulk lot of seeds.
*   **(11)** "Person" includes any individual, partnership, corporation, company, society, or association.
*   **(12)** "Place of business" is that place from which seed is sold and includes a:

        *   **(a)** "Retail place of business" where seed is held for sale and sold, or held for sale and offered for sale to the end user;
    *   **(b)** "Wholesale place of business" where seed is held for sale and sold, or held for sale and offered for sale to a seed dealer.

*   **(18)** "Vegetable seeds" includes the seeds of those crops which are grown in gardens or on truck farms and are generally known and sold under the name of vegetable seeds in this state.
*   **Note: The statute does not define "sell" or "for sale," despite these terms' repeated use below.**
*   **THE MISSOURI GENERAL ASSEMBLY SHOULD DEFINE "SELL" AND "FOR SALE" TO EXCLUDE SEED LIBRARIES**

**266.031.1 Permits required, fees, terms—penalty for late application.**

*   Any person who **sells, distributes, offers or exposes for sale** any agricultural or vegetable seed in the state of Missouri shall obtain a seed permit from the director of agriculture unless exempted as in section <u>[266.080](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000801.html)</u>. Seed dealers must purchase permits for each seed sales classification performed, selling or taking orders for seed from other than an established place of business, selling seed from a retail place of business, selling seed from a wholesale place of business, or negotiating sales as a broker. A separate permit shall be required for each place of business from which seed regulated by this law is sold. A separate permit shall also be required of each person selling or taking orders for seed from other than an established place of business... [Goes on to describe permits terms and fees in detail].
*   **Note: This language does not explicitly state whether the condition "for sale" applies to "distributes" and "offers" or only to "exposes," but other provisions (_e.g._, 266.071.1 below) repeat the term "for sale" wherever it (apparently) applies, indicating the above licensing requirements apply to any person who "distributes" or "offers" seed, even if not "for sale."**
*   **THE MISSOURI GENERAL ASSEMBLY SHOULD  EXEMPT SEED LIBRARIES FROM PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS EITHER BY NAMING THEM AS AN EXEMPT CATEGORY OR MAKING "FOR SALE" A CONDITION FOR _ANY _TYPE OF TRANSACTION, INCLUDING "DISTRIBUTE" AND "OFFER," TO REQUIRE A PERMIT.**

**266.051.1 Label requirements for agricultural seeds.**

*   Each **container of agricultural seed of more than one pound and vegetable seed in any amount** which is sold, offered for sale, **transported**, or exposed for sale, within this state for seeding purposes shall bear thereon or have attached thereto in a conspicuous place a plainly written or printed label or tag in the English language, giving the following information: ... [Goes on to list many detailed labeling requirements].
*   **Note: "Sold," "offered for sale," and "exposed for sale" are undefined, but even if  these terms exclude seed libraries, labeling requirements apply to seed "transported," even if not "for sale."**
*   **MISSOURI SHOULD DEFINE "TRANSPORTED," "SELL," AND "FOR SALE" TO CLEARLY EXCLUDE SEED LIBRARIES.**

**266.071 Sales, offers for sale and acts prohibited.**

*   **1. **It is unlawful for any person to **sell, distribute, offer for sale, or expose for sale** any agricultural or vegetable seed within this state:

        *   **(1)** Unless the test to determine the percentage of germination was performed within ten months of the time the seed is sold, exposed for sale, offered for sale or distributed. An exception shall be allowed for seed packaged in hermetically sealed containers, which may be sold, exposed for sale, offered for sale or transported up to thirty-six months after the test to determine the percentage of germination, if the seed is packaged according to the regulation governing hermetically packaged seed;
    *   **(2)** Not labeled in accordance with the provisions of sections <u>[266.011](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000111.html)</u> to <u>[266.111](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600001111.html)</u> or having a false or misleading labeling;
    *   **(3)** Which has false or misleading advertisement;
    *   **(4)** Containing prohibited weed seeds;
    *   **(5)** Containing noxious weed seeds in excess of one-half percent, or in excess of the number declared on the label attached to the container of the seed;
    *   **(6)** Containing more than two percent by weight of weed seeds, except for Brome grass, orchard grass or fescue which may not exceed three percent;
    *   **(7)** Which is represented to be certified, registered, foundation, or any other term conveying a similar meaning when referring to seed unless it has been produced, processed, and labeled in accordance with procedures and in compliance with the rules and regulations of an officially recognized certifying agency.

*   **2.** It is unlawful for any person within this state:

        *   **(4)** To **sell** noxious or prohibitive weed seed except as provided in section <u>[266.080](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000801.html)</u>;
    *   **(5)** To **sell** seed to persons performing the seed sale functions listed in subdivision (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection 1 of section <u>[266.031](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000311.html)</u>, unless the person buying has a retail permit to sell seed;
    *   **(6)** To **permit** seed to move into this state which does not meet the standards of the seed certifying agency of the state in which the seed originated or the provisions of Missouri seed law.

*   **Note: This provision uses the language "sell, distribute, offer for sale, or expose for sale" to apply its prohibitions to those who "distribute" without any relation to a sale. This means seed libraries that "distribute" seeds _not for sale_ must test, label, and exclude weeds from their seeds. This places a significant and unnecessary burden on seed libraries.**
*   **MISSOURI CAN EXEMPT SEED LIBRARIES FROM THESE PROHIBITIONS INTENDED FOR _SALES_ BY AMENDING THIS PROVISION TO CLEARLY APPLY ONLY TO PERSONS WHO DISTRIBUTE SEEDS _FOR SALE_ AND DEFINING "FOR SALE" TO EXCLUDE SEED LIBRARIES.**

**266.076 Records required—inspection—retention.**

*   **All wholesale places of business** shall maintain records showing kind of seed, quantity, date of shipment, consignee and consignor. **Records on seed sales** must be made available during normal business hours, at the seed dealer's place of business for the director when he has preceded the time of inspection by a request in writing. Seed records shall be maintained for a period of three years.
*   **Note: The code's definition "wholesale place of business" (see 266.021 above) does not clearly suggest this provision applies to seed libraries, but, if these record-keeping requirements apply to seed libraries, they would create a lot of unnecessary paperwork for the staff. "Seed sales" does not clearly include seed library activities, but that depends on what constitutes a "sale." This ambiguity further demonstrates the need for a clear definition of "sale" that excludes seed libraries.**

**266.080 Exemptions.**

*   The provisions of sections <u>[266.051](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000511.html)</u>, <u>[266.061](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000611.html)</u> and <u>[266.071](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000711.html)</u> shall not apply:
*   **(1)** To seed or grain not intended for seeding purposes;
*   **(2)** To seed in storage, or being transported or consigned to an establishment for cleaning or processing; provided, that the invoice or labeling accompanying any shipment of said seed bears the statement "seed for processing"; and provided that any labeling or other representation which may be made with respect to the uncleaned or unprocessed seed shall be subject to this law;
*   **(3)** To any carrier in respect to any seed transported or delivered for transportation in the ordinary course of its business as a carrier; provided, that such carrier is not engaged in producing, processing, or marketing agricultural or vegetable seed subject to the provisions of this law;
*   **(4)** To a farmer who sells unlabeled seed of his own production;
*   **(5)** To seed for use in experimental or breeding purposes, when approved by the director of agriculture on a form established by regulation.

**266.101 Seed subject to seizure, when—proceedings—disposition of condemned seed.**

*   Any lot of agricultural or vegetable seed found in the possession of a single owner or custodian and not in compliance with the provisions of this law shall be subject to seizure upon complaint of the director of the department of agriculture to the circuit court of the county or city in which such seed is located. Such seizure shall not be made until the owner or custodian of the seed has been given sixty days from the date of a "stop-sale" order to bring the seed in compliance with the provisions of this law. In the event the court finds that the seed does not comply with this law, it shall order the condemnation thereof, and the seed shall be denatured, processed, destroyed, relabeled, or otherwise disposed of by the court; provided, that either party may demand a trial by jury on any issue of fact joined in any such case; and provided further, that in no instance shall the court order such disposition of said seed without first having given the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for the release of said seed or permission to process or relabel said seed to bring it into compliance with this law.
*   **Note: The possibility of seizure demonstrates why it is so important to ensure seed libraries are exempt from any and all seed laws that ought not apply to non-commercial seed distribution.**

**266.111 Penalties for violations—attorney general to act on request, when, procedure—publication by director of result of legal action.**

*   **1.** Every violation of the provisions of this law shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars for the first offense and not exceeding one thousand dollars for each subsequent similar offense.
*   **2.** The director may report any violation of the provisions of sections <u>[266.011](http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/26600000111.html)</u> to 266.111 to the prosecuting attorney of the county where the violation occurs. The prosecuting attorney may institute appropriate proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction. If any prosecuting attorney refuses or fails to act on request of the director, the attorney general shall so act; however, no prosecution under this law shall be instituted without the defendant first having been given an opportunity to appear before the director of agriculture or his duly authorized agent, to introduce evidence either in person or by agent or attorney at a private hearing. If, after such hearing, or without such hearing in case the defendant or his agent or attorney fails or refuses to appear, the director of agriculture is of the opinion that the evidence warrants prosecution, he shall proceed as herein provided.
*   **3.** It is the duty of the director of agriculture or the attorney general, as the case may be, to institute proceedings at once against any person charged with a violation of this law, if, in the judgment of such officer, the information submitted warrants such action.
*   **4.** After judgment by the court in any case arising under this law, the director of agriculture shall publish any information pertinent to the issuance of the judgment by the court in such media as he may designate.
*   **Note: The possibility of fines up to $500 for a first offense and $1,000 thereafter for _each_ seed law violation shows how important it is that seed libraries be exempt from unnecessary legal restrictions and that the applicability of these laws to seed libraries be absolutely clear. Seed libraries cannot afford to risk accruing fines whenever they violate a rule it is unclear even applies to them.**
