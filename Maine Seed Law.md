# Maine Seed Law

Maine Seed Law [here](http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/7/title7ch103sec0.html), under Subchapter 11.

## Summary

Sections 1043 and 1044 of the Maine Seed Law subjects seeds that are 'sold,' 'offered for sale,' or 'exposed for sale' to 'Label Requirements' and 'Prohibitions.' However, the law does not include definitions for 'sell,' 'offer for sale,' or 'expose for sale.'  Although the law exempts "seed or grain not intended for sowing purposes" from compliance with these Sections, this is also not defined. The legal implications for seed libraries depend on the interpretation of "grain not intended for sowing purposes," and whether seed libraries fall under that description.
