[FAQ on Kentucky Seed Law](http://www.rs.uky.edu/seed/information/law/FAQlaw.php)

[Do I need this permit?](http://www.rs.uky.edu/seed/permit/index.php) - This is a website on the Univ. of Kentucky's website that helps someone decide what permit, if any, they need for distributing seed in Kentucky. It seems that none of the 4 permit types apply to seed libraries.

**250.021 Definitions for KRS 250.021 to 250.111.**

As used in KRS 250.021 to 250.111, unless the context requires otherwise:

**(9)** "Distribute" means to consign, offer for sale, sell, advertise for sale, barter, or otherwise supply agricultural seed.

**(10)** "Distributor" means any person who distributes agricultural seed.

**(20)** "Label" includes a tag or other device attached to or written, stamped, or printed on any container of seed or accompanying any lot of bulk seed purporting to set forth the information required on the seed label by KRS 250.021 to 250.111, and it may include other information relating to the labeled seed.

**(27)** "Permit holder" means a person who has obtained a permit from the director to label agricultural, vegetable, or flower seed; or combination mulch, seed, and fertilizer products distributed in Kentucky and whose name and address is required to appear on labels of those products distributed in Kentucky as a condition for obtaining the permit. 

**(28)** "Person" means an individual, partnership, company, corporation, or other type of business establishment.

**(37)** "Vegetable seed" means the seed of those crops which are grown in gardens and on truck farms and are generally known and sold under the name of vegetable or herb seed in Kentucky.

**250.031 Application of KRS 250.021 to 250. 111.**

*   This section describes the types of transactions that the seed law does not apply to. Here might be a location for an exemption that includes seed libraries.

**250.041 Labeling requirements.**

**(1)** Every lot of agricultural seed, when in bulk or a container of one (1) pound or more, or in the case of tobacco seed of one-twelfth (1/12) ounce or more; each packet or other container of vegetable or flower seed; each preplanted container, mat, tape, or other planting device containing vegetable or flower seed; and each container of a combination mulch, seed, and fertilizer product distributed in Kentucky for planting purposes shall bear or have attached in a conspicuous place a plainly written or printed label in the English language providing the information stipulated in subsection (10) of this section.

**(3)** The label specified in this section shall be delivered **to the purchaser** with every distribution of agricultural seed, if the distribution amounts to one (1) pound or more, whether the distribution is in bulk or in package.

**(10)** Labels giving the following information, which statement shall not be modified or denied in the labeling or on another label attached to the container, shall be used:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>**(b)** For vegetable seed in packets as prepared for use in home gardens or household plantings or vegetable seed in preplanted containers, mats, tapes, or other planting devices: 

*   **1.** The name and address of the person who labeled the seed;
*   **2.** Name of kind and variety of seed;
*   **3.** Lot identification, such as by lot number or other means;
*   **4.** The year for which the seed was packed for distribution as "Packed for ------" or the percentage germination and the calendar month and year the test was completed to determine such percentage; 

**(c)** For vegetable seed in containers other than packets prepared for use in home gardens or household plantings and other than preplanted containers, mats, tapes, or other planting devices: 
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>**1. **The name and address of the person who labeled the seed;</li>
<li>**2.** The name of each kind and variety present in excess of five percent (5%) and the percentage by weight of each in order of its predominance;</li>
<li>**3.** Lot number or other lot identification; and</li>
<li>**4.** For each named vegetable seed: 

*   **a.** Percentage of germination, exclusive of hard seed;
*   **b.** Percentage of hard seed, if present; and
*   **c.** The calendar month and year the test was completed to determine the percentages. 
</ul style="list-style: none;">

*   **5.** The labeling requirements for vegetable seed in containers of more than one (1) pound shall be deemed to have been met if the seed is weighed from a properly labeled container in the presence of the purchaser.

*   **NOTE: Subsection (3) describes that the label needs to be provided to "each purchaser" of seed, which is evidence that this law is intended to regulate commercial seed sales and not the sharing of seed for free among individuals through a seed library.**

**250.051 Permits for labeling -- Fees -- Registration.**

**(1)** The following shall apply with regard to permits for labeling:

*   **(b)** Each person who labels vegetable seed, flower seed, or combination mulch, seed, and fertilizer product shall obtain a labeling permit from the director.

**(4)** The yearly registration fee for retail agricultural seed dealers and for noncertified custom seed conditioners shall be twenty-five dollars ($25).

**250.071 Unlawful acts.**

It shall be unlawful:

**(1)** To distribute any agricultural seed, mixtures of agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or flower seed, for seeding purposes which is not labeled in compliance with the provisions of KRS 250.041 or which has false or misleading labeling.

**250.091 Annual free test for Kentucky citizens.**

Any Kentucky citizen may submit one (1) sample per year for test free of charge if the sample is accompanied by a signed statement: "I certify that I have not previously submitted a sample for free test during the current calendar year (signature)."
