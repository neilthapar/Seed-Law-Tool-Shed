# Delaware Seed Law

[Text of the Delaware Seed Law](http://delcode.delaware.gov/title3/c015/index.shtml)

(Delaware Code Title 3, Part II, Chapter 15 Seeds)

## Summary

**THIS LAW SHOULD BE CLARIFIED AND/OR CHANGED. **The Delaware seed law only regulates seed that is "sold" in the state. Unfortunately, the statute does not elaborate on the definition of "sold." As seen in the seed laws of other states, this term can include "exchanges" where no money changes hands. The statute should clarify what exactly "sold" means, and exempt seed libraries if they do, in fact, come under the law's scope. 

**§ 1501 Definitions.**

**(1)** "Person" includes any individual, partnership, corporation, company, society or association.

**(2)** "Agricultural seed" includes the seeds of grass, forage, cereal, and fiber crops and other kinds of seeds commonly recognized within this State as agricultural seeds, lawn seeds and mixes of such seeds, and may include noxious weed seeds when the Department determines that such seed is being used as agricultural seed.

**§ 1502 Label requirements — Agricultural, vegetable and flower seeds.**

Each container of agricultural, vegetable and flower seeds which is sold, offered for sale or exposed for sale, or transported within this State for sowing purposes shall bear thereon or have attached thereto in a conspicuous place a plainly written or printed label or tag in the English language, giving the following information, which statement shall not be modified or denied in the labeling or on another label attached to the container:

**(1)** For all agricultural, vegetable and flower seeds treated as defined in this chapter (for which a separate label may be used):

**a.** A word or statement indicating that the seed has been treated;

**b.** The commonly accepted coined, chemical or abbreviated chemical (generic) name of the applied substance or description of the process used;

**c.** If the substance in the amount present with the seed is harmful to human or other vertebrate animals, a caution statement such as "Do not use for food, feed or oil purposes." The caution for mercurials and similarly toxic substances shall be a poison statement or symbol;
