# Oklahoma Seed Law

[Seed Law & Rules](http://www.oda.state.ok.us/forms/law/okseedlaw.htm) 

**<u>Summary</u>**

*   The Oklahoma Seed Law is not clear on whether it prohibits or allows "giving away seeds." It is unclear whether seed sharing would be covered by the state's seed law and needs to be changed to exempt seed libraries. The statute should exempt seed libraries from the labeling and testing requirements.

**§2-8-21: Definitions: **

*   **(2)** **"Agricultural seeds" **means the seeds of grass, forage, cereal and fiber crops, and any other kinds of seeds commonly recognized within this state as agricultural seeds, lawn seeds, and mixtures of seeds; 
*   **(3) "Certified seed", “registered seed", and “foundation seed”** means seed that has been produced and labeled in accordance with the procedures and rules of an officially recognized seed-certifying agency or association;
*   **(4)** **"Coated seed"** means a seed unit covered with any substance which changes the size, shape, or weight of the original seed.  Seeds coated with ingredients including, but not limited to, rhizobia, dyes, and pesticides are excluded;
*   **(7)  "Labeling"** means all written, printed, or graphic representations accompanying and pertaining to any seed in bulk or in containers and includes, but is not limited to representations on invoices;
*   **(9)**  **"Noxious weed seeds"** shall be divided into two classes, "prohibited noxious weed seeds" and "restricted noxious weed seeds" as defined in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph.  The State Board of Agriculture may promulgate rules that add to or subtract from the list of seeds included under either definition:

*   **(10)** **“Pure seed”** means agricultural and vegetable seeds, exclusive of inert matter, and all other seeds not of the kinds, or kinds and varieties, being considered;
*   **(13)** **"Stop sale"** means an administrative order provided by law restraining the sale, use, disposition, and movement of a specific quantity of seed;
*   ** (14)**  **"Treated seed"** means seed that has been treated with an approved substance or subjected to a process designed to control or repel plant disease organisms, insects, or other pests attacking the seed or plants or will improve the planting value of the seed;
*   **(16) ** **“Vegetable seeds"** means seeds of those crops which are grown in gardens and on truck farms and are generally known and sold under the name of vegetable seeds in this state; and

**§ 2-8-22 Label Requirements: **

Label requirements are stated for each bag, container, package, or bulk of agricultural seed transported, sold, offered for sale, or exposed for sale by any person within the State of Oklahoma for planting purposes. There is a separate labeling requirement for agricultural seeds, vegetable seeds, and coated seeds. 

*   **Note: Oklahoma Seed Law does not mention "giving away" seeds but does enforce a labeling requirement for large bulk that are being transported. Even bags of agricultural seeds transported for planting purposes must be labeled. There should be clarification that this does not apply to seed libraries.**

**§ 2-8-23 Unlawful Acts: **

*   **Note: It is not defined whether "giving away" seeds would be exempt from the unlawful acts below. The seed law should explicitly exclude seed libraries from burdensome labeling requirements. **

**<u>A.  It shall be unlawful for any person to sell,</u>** **<u>offer for sale, or expose for sale</u>** any agricultural seed or vegetable seed within this state:
