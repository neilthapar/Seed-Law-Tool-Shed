Arizona Seed Law
Text of the Arizona Seed Law and Seed Rules

 * Summary
The Arizona Seed Law contains an expansive definition of "sell," which includes "exchange, barter, or trade" in seeds. The key for seed libraries is to ensure that the giving and receiving of seeds is not characterized by any of these terms. Since the labeling, germination testing, and record-keeping requirements of the law only apply if seed is sold or transported, seed libraries should not be subject to these requirements as long as they can show that they are not "selling" seed as defined in the law.

The law does, however, give broad authority to the Director of the Department of Agriculture to apply this law "to the extent he deems necessary to determine whether...seeds are in compliance with the provisions of this article...." This means that the Director, may, in his or her discretion, apply this law to seed libraries. For this reason, this law should be changed to expressly exempt seed libraries from regulation under this article.

3-231. Definitions
In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:
 * 6. “Dealer” means any person who sells seed.
 * 13. “Labeler” means any person whose name and address appear on the label pertaining to or attached to a lot or container of agricultural, vegetable or ornamental plant seed sold, offered for sale, exposed for sale or transported for sowing purposes.
 * 21. “Sell” means offer for sale, expose for sale, possess for sale, exchange, barter or trade.
 * NOTES: Expansive definition of sell, but violations only apply to dealers who sell seed commercially, so may not apply to seed libraries. Additionally, seed libraries giving and receiving seed may not be properly characterized as exchanging, bartering, or trading, so what seed libraries are doing should not be considered "sell" as defined here.

3-232. Enforcement of article
A. The director shall enforce the provisions of this article. The director shall:
 * 1. Sample, inspect, analyze and test agricultural, vegetable and ornamental plant seed transported, sold or offered or exposed for sale for sowing purposes, as provided by section 3-233 and to the extent he deems necessary to determine whether the agricultural, vegetable and ornamental plant seeds are in compliance with the provisions of this article, and he shall notify promptly the person who transported, sold, offered or exposed the seed for sale of any violation.
 * 2. Prescribe and, after public hearing following due public notice, adopt rules governing:
   * (a) The methods of sampling, inspecting, analyzing, testing and examining agricultural, vegetable and ornamental plant seed and the tolerances to be followed in the administration of this article that comply with the federal seed act (7 United States Code sections 1551 through 1611; 53 Stat. 1275) and the rules and regulations promulgated under that act.
   * (b) A prohibited and restricted noxious weed list and subsequent revisions to the list. (c) Reasonable standards of germination for vegetable seeds.
   * (d) Such other rules as are necessary to secure the efficient enforcement of this article.
 * 3. Designate seed certifying agencies which he finds qualified to certify agricultural or vegetable seeds as to variety, purity, quality or other related designation. The director shall consult with the director of the University of Arizona agricultural experiment station before approving the qualifications of any agency to certify as to variety, strain or other genetic character of agricultural or vegetable seeds.
B. The director may assign personnel from the office of inspections to perform any of the inspection- related activities prescribed by this article.
 * NOTES: This article only applies to seed that is "transported, sold or offered or exposed for sale," so should not apply to seed libraries. However, it also allows for the Director to apply this law "to the extent he deems necessary to determine...compliance with the provisions of this article," which seems to give the Director broad authority to potentially regulate seed libraries.

3-235. Seed dealer and labeler licenses; fee; exception
A. An Arizona seed dealer or an out-of-state seed dealer who sells, distributes, processes or mixes for the use of others any agricultural, vegetable or ornamental plant seed, except vegetable and ornamental plant seed in packages of less than one pound, shall obtain a license from the division, authorizing the dealer to sell, distribute, process or mix such seed. A dealer is not entitled to have a license unless the dealer has an established plant, warehouse or place of business. A separate seed dealer license is required for each place of business in this state from which seed regulated by this article is sold.
B. A seed labeler who labels any agricultural, vegetable or ornamental plant seed for sale, distribution or processing shall obtain a seed labeler license from the division for each place of business at which seed regulated by article is labeled.
C. An application for a license shall be accompanied by the fee prescribed by section 3-233. A license shall be renewed annually not later than July 1, and the application for renewal shall be accompanied by the fee prescribed by section 3-233.
D. This section does not apply to a farmer growing seed crops for sale to a seed dealer or labeler. The portion of crops received by an individual who harvests the producer’s crop and receives part of the crop as payment for services rendered in the harvesting shall be exempt from this section.
 * NOTES: This section applies to seed dealers, which are defined as anyone who sells seeds, so this should not apply to seed libraries. Even so, for libraries that are distributing seed in packages of less than one pound, this section would not apply.

3-236. Retention of invoices and records
Each person whose name appears on the label of and handles agricultural and vegetable seeds subject to this article shall keep for a period of two years complete records of each lot of agricultural or vegetable seed handled, and keep for one year a file sample of each lot of seed after disposition of the lot. All records pertaining to the lot or lots involved shall be accessible for inspection during customary business hours. All invoices, receiving records and records of purchases must have the kind, variety and lot number of seed sold in the state of Arizona.
 * NOTES: Record-keeping requirements if this law applies.

3-237. Label requirements; rules
The director shall adopt rules to specify labeling requirements for each container of agricultural, vegetable and ornamental plant seed sold, offered for sale, exposed for sale or transported in this state for sowing purposes. The labeling requirements shall include:
 * 1. Germination.
 * 2. Purity.
 * 3. Noxious weed content.
 * 4. Precautionary statements the director considers to be necessary.
 * 5. Labeler or packager information.
 * 6. Seed origin.
 * 7. Other issues the director considers to be necessary.

3-243. Seed labeling regulation; state preemption
The regulation and use of seeds are of statewide concern. The regulation of seeds pursuant to this article and their use is not subject to further regulation by a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state.
