Text of the Georgia Rules and Regulations on Seed: [Chapter 40-12](http://rules.sos.state.ga.us/gac/40-12)

## Summary

The Georgia Seed Law requires certain labeling for any seeds <u>sold, offered for sale, exposed for sale, or transported within this state for planting purposes</u>. The labeling requirements include, among other things, germination test results, lot numbers, and addresses of the labelers. Because seed libraries do not do any of the activities underlined above, this seed law should not apply. Additionally, there is an exemption for farmers who sell seed on their farm and do not advertise or transport such seeds on a public carrier.

The Georgia Rules and Regulations regarding seed define a "seed dealer" as someone who "<u>sells seed, including persons who label seed, transfer and market seed within the trade or sell seed to purchasers.</u>" Seed libraries and other community-based seed sharing initatives can exclude themselves from this definition by not engaging in any of the activities described in this definition.

**2-11-22. Labeling requirements.**
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>**(a) **Labeling required. Each bag, container, package, or bulk of seeds which is <u>sold, offered for sale, exposed for sale, or transported within this state for planting purposes</u> shall bear thereon or have attached thereto in a conspicuous place a plainly written or printed label or tag in the English language, giving the information specified in subsections (b) through (j) of this Code section, which statement shall not be modified or denied in the labeling or on another label attached to the container. The labeler is responsible to assure that the required labeling is applied to each container or, in the case of bulk seed, that required labeling is shown on the invoice. All invoices and records pertaining to the shipment or sale of seed must show each lot number.</li>
<li>**(f)** For vegetable seeds in containers of one pound or less or preplanted containers, mats, tapes, or other planting devices, the following information shall be given:

*   (1)  The name of kind and variety of seed;

*   (3)  The year for which the seed was packed for sale as 'Packed for __________' or the percent germination and the calendar month and year the test was completed to determine such percentage;

**2-11-32. Exemption from article.**

No person or vendor shall be subject to the penalties of this article for having sold or offered or exposed for sale in this state any seed incorrectly labeled or represented as to variety or origin when the variety or origin of such seed could not be identified by examination thereof, unless he or she failed to obtain an invoice, growerâ€™s declaration, or other document indicating variety and origin and failed to take such other precautions as were necessary or required to ensure that the identity and variety of the seed were as stated.

Code Sections 2-11-21 and 2-11-22 shall not apply:

**(2) **<u>To seed grown by a farmer or other person, who sells it as such, when it is sold at his or her own farm and he or she does not advertise or transfer it by any public carrier provided such activity is not in conflict with paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Code Section 2-11-23 or requirements of the United States Plant Variety Protection Act;</u>

**(3) **To seed or grain not intended for planting purposes, provided that such seed or grain sold to a farmer or consumer which could be used for planting purposes shall be marked or tagged 'for feed' or 'not for planting'; and
