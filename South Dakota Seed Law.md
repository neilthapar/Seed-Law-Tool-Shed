# South Dakota Seed Law

**Summary: Seed libraries would be regulated under South Dakota law, requiring them to obtain a permit, submit to random inspections and comply with labeling and advertising rules. **

**Section 38-12A-11 includes the word "distribute," requiring those who distribute seeds to hold a permit and comply with advertising and labeling regulations. If this word was removed, it might be enough to exempt seed libraries because all of the other code sections refer to "selling" (selling is not defined, so is taken to have it's ordinary meaning). **

**The labeling and advertising requirements include listing the germination percentage and if it is "below standard." **

38-12A-1 Definitions

(1)      **"Advertisement,"** all representation, other than those on the label, disseminated in any manner or by any means, relating to seed within the scope of this chapter;

(2)      **"Agricultural seeds," **the seeds of grass, forage, cereal, oil, fiber, and other kinds of crop seed commonly recognized within this state as agricultural seed and combinations of such seeds;

(15)      **"Label,"** a tag or other written, printed or graphic representations, in any format whatsoever, accompanying or pertaining to any seed, whether in bulk or in containers purporting to set forth the information required on the label by this chapter;

(19)      **"Prohibited noxious weed seed,"** any weed seed which is prohibited from being present in seed, such as the seeds of weeds which are highly destructive and difficult to control by good cultural practice and the use of herbicides;

 (21)      **"Record,"** any and all information which relates to the origin, transport, treatment, germination, purity, kind, and variety of each lot of seed sold in this state. Such information includes seed samples and records of declaration, labels, purchases, sales, conditioning, bulking, treatment, handling, storage, analyses, tests, and examinations;

(25)     ** "Seed,"** all propagation materials, within the context of this chapter ultimately intended for planting purposes;

(26)      **"Seed dealer,"** any person who exposes seed for sale, maintains an unsold inventory and sells seed, or takes and fills orders for seed for a seedsman or seed producer but does not condition or label seed;

(27)      **"Seedsman,"** any person who purchases, conditions, **_labels_**, or sells seed as a major part of his business;

(28)     ** "Seed producer,"** any person who labels and sells seed only of his own production;

  (36)      **"Vegetable seed,"** the seeds of those crops which are grown in gardens and on truck farms and are generally known and sold under the name of vegetable or herb seed in this state;

*    ** Note: a seed library could be considered a "seedsman" by the act of "labeling" seeds. All the other definitions involve selling seeds.**

**38-12A-11.   Seed dealers permit required--**Exception--Expiration--Fee. **<u>No person may sell, _distribute</u>_<u>, advertise, solicit orders for, offer for sale, expose for sale, or transport seed</u>** without first obtaining from the Department of Agriculture a permit to engage in the business. **<u>No permit is required of any person selling or advertising seed of the person's own production in South Dakota, if the seed is stored or delivered to a purchaser only on or from the farm or premises where grown or the production and sale of seed is not a primary endeavor and primary source of income to such persons</u>**. Each permit shall expire on the thirty-first day of December of the year following the date of issue. The biennial fee for a seed permit is: Seedsman-- five hundred dollars; Seed producer-- seventy-five dollars; Seed dealer-- seventy-five dollars.

*   **Note: a permit is required if seed is being <u>distributed </u>by a non-farmer, or a farmer distributes seed in a place other than their farm and it is their primary business endeavor. This would apply to seed libraries "distributing" seed. **

**38-12A-2.**   **Label required for containers of agricultural seeds--**Contents.

**38-12A-10.   Exceptions to labeling requirements. The provisions of §§ 38-12A-2 to 38-12A-6, inclusive, do not apply to:**

             (1)      Seed or grain not intended for sowing purposes;

             (2)      Seed in storage in or being transported or consigned to a conditioning establishment for conditioning, provided that the invoice or labeling accompanying any lot of seed bears the statement "seed for conditioning" and provided that any labeling or other representation which may be made with respect to the unconditioned seed shall be subject to this chapter;

             (3)      Seed which is in the possession of a seedsman or seed producer and has been conditioned or carried over from a previous sales season or is being transported to another seedsman **provided that the seed is not exposed to consumers** and that either a test to determine label information is in progress or that the records or a representative label with or accompanying each lot contain current label information;

             (4)      Any carrier with respect to seed transported or delivered for transportation in the ordinary course of its business as a carrier, provided that the carrier is not engaged in producing, conditioning, or marketing seeds subject to this chapter;

Such seeds, if taken to community sales for sale or if publicly advertised for sale or containing "noxious weeds" shall be labeled in accordance with this chapter.**

**Note: each labeling section recites "intent to sell" the seed, so the labeling requirements arguably do not apply to seed libraries. However, a specific exception is not listed for those who are merely distributing seeds.**

**38-12A-12.   Contents of advertisement by person excepted from seed permit.** 

Any person excepted from a seed permit pursuant to § 38-12A-11 who advertise seed in this state shall comply with this chapter. The advertisement shall include but not be limited to:

     A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor.

38-12A-18.   Additional civil penalty. In addition to the criminal penalties imposed under this chapter, a person is subject to a further civil penalty to the State of South Dakota as prescribed by the secretary pursuant to § 38-12A-20 not to exceed ten times the retail value of any seed involved in the violation or a maximum of one thousand dollars per violation.
