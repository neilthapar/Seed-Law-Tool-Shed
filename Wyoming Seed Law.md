# Wyoming Seed Law

[Text of the Wyoming Seed Law](http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/statutes.aspx?file=titles/Title11/T11CH12.htm) (WY Stat. Title 11, Chapter 12, Sections 101-125)

## Summary

*   This law seems very vague, albeit it is understandable - to me- that Wyoming wants to control weed seeds and curtail any grain seeds, particularly those which are certifiable (have certain characteristics or trademark), along with any fraud that could be perpetrated by anyone (individual, seed seller/distributor, or corporation - albeit the latter not being provided here). However, what is the criteria by which anyone determines whether or not  seed is certifiable (11-12-120), and does an individual who wants certification induce a seller to break the law to provide that certification? Moreover, (11-12-102) exempts a person who does not intend to sell his seed or plant it: the point there is? However, it all comes down to the victim's perception of what was sold to him/her in terms of quality and whether or not under Wyoming law the seed law has been violated.
*   Thanks for this summary, Kim. This law is vague in some respects. For example, there is no definition of "sell" to define whether seed sharing would fall into that definition. In this case, it would be reasonable to believe that non-commercial sharing of seeds **does not** consitute selling seeds. In fact, the licensing, lableling, and testing requirements only apply to the "sale and offer for sale or distribution" of seeds, which should not apply to seed libraries or any other non-commercial seed sharing activity. The exemption for seed not intended for planting exists to apply to seed cleaners and conditioners, since they are just in temporary possession of seeds.

*   (ii) Is a resident grower of seed who sells his seed to a seed dealer who is licensed pursuant to this act<u>;</u>
*   (iii) Repealed By Laws 2006, Chapter 114, 2. 

(b) Any resident grower who sells or offers for sale any agricultural, vegetable, flower or tree seeds grown only by him and sold or offered for sale at the headquarters of his operations directly to grower planters of the seed and not for resale is exempt from <u>the licensing provisions</u> under W.S. 11-12-103. 

**11-12-103. Licensing.**  

**(a)** Any person who **sells or offers for sale or distribution** in Wyoming any seeds shall obtain a license from the department. The license shall expire annually on March 31. Application for the license shall include the name and address of the person to whom the license is to be issued and the location of the place 

or places of business of the applicant. The application shall be accompanied by the license fee authorized by W.S. 11-1-104 for each place of business selling seeds in packets, packages or bulk of ten (10) pounds or more. This subsection shall not apply to any person licensed in accordance with W.S. 11-11-103.

**(c) Charitable and educational institutions shall be exempt from licensing requirements imposed by this section**.

*   **NOTE: Interesting to note here that Wyoming law exempts any charitable and educational institutions from the licensing requirement. Presumably, seed libraries and other organizations that promote non-commercial seed sharing are exempted from the licensing requirement, but it's not clear that informal, unincorporated groups would be able to use this exemption.**

**11-12-104. Restrictions on the sale of weed seeds; allowed tolerance for other noxious weeds; rulemaking. **

(a) No person **shall sell or offer for sale or distribution** in Wyoming seed which contains any prohibited noxious weed seeds.

*   (ii) The full name and address of the person selling, offering or distributing the seeds for sale;  
*   (iii) The percentage of pure seed, crop seed (not to be added to pure seed), inert matter, common weed seeds by weight, germination, hard seed and the month and year of the germination test;

**11-12-107. Weed seeds.  **

No person shall **sell in the retail trade** in this state, any seed which contains two percent (2%) or more of weed seeds by weight.

Screenings of any seeds or grains which are **offered for sale** by any person shall be legibly labeled as such and not sold as seeds. They shall be free of prohibited noxious weed seeds and shall not exceed the tolerance established on restricted noxious weed seed. Screenings found to contain weed seeds in violation of this section are subject to seizure by the director of the department of agriculture.

*   Some seed laws include discretionary enforcement, but it seems that in Wyoming that is not the case. The director is explicitly directed to enforce all provisions of this act. In the event that a change in enforcement practices is required, it may be more difficult to convince the director to stop enforcing a law because it seems inappropriate since s/he as a specific legal mandate to enforce. Legislative changes would be necessary in this case to override the Director's enforcement in this case.

**11-12-114. Seed and grain cleaning establishments; certificates of approval; lists thereof.  **

**11-12-120. False labeling of seeds; prohibited.**

It is unlawful for any person to attach or cause to be attached to any container of seeds or propagating materials, for the purpose of certifying the contents, any label or tag describing the contents as certified seed or propagating material, except labels or tags which are issued by the seed certification service of the college of agriculture, University of Wyoming, for the purpose of certification.

**11-12-121. False labeling of seeds; false labeling as prima facie evidence of violation.  **

Any label or tag prohibited by W.S. 11-12-120 found attached to any container of seed or propagating material is prima facie evidence of a violation of W.S. 11-12-120 by the person falsely labeling or tagging the container.
