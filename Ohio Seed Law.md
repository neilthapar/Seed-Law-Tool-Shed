**907.01 - Agricultural seed certification and labeling definitions.**

As used in sections 907.01 to [907.17](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.17) of the Revised Code:

*   **(P)** "Person" means any individual, partnership, corporation, company, society, association, public agency, receiver, trustee, or agent.

*   **NOTES: The definition of "sell" in this statute is broad and includes "giving away" seed. Sell is not defined as only covering commercial transactions, which exposes seed sharing activities to being covered within this law.**

**907.03 - Label requirements for containers of agricultural or vegetable seed.**
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>(A) Each container of agricultural, vegetable, or flower seed **that is sold for sowing purposes** shall bear on it or have attached to it in a conspicuous place a label plainly written or printed in the English language giving the following information:<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>(1) For agricultural seed that is sold on a pure live seed basis or any other basis**...**</li>
<li>(3) **For vegetable seed that is sold in containers weighing eight ounces or less**:<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>(a) The name of the kind and variety of the seed; </li>
<li>(b) For seed that germinates less than the germination standard established by the director under division (B)(3) of section [907.10](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.10) of the Revised Code:<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>(i) The percentage of germination, exclusive of hard seed; the percentage of hard seed, if present; and the calendar month and year the test was completed to determine these percentages; </li>
<li>(ii) "Below standard" in not less than 8-point type in a conspicuous place on the same side of the label as that which states the percentage of germination or on the face of the container.</li>
<li>The percentage of germination of seed determined to be equal to or above the standard may be, but is not required to be, stated on the label or container. </li></ul style="list-style: none;">
</li>

</li>
<li>(4) For vegetable seed that is sold in containers weighing more than eight ounces:<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>(a) The name of each kind and variety of vegetable seed present in excess of five per cent and the percentage by weight of each in order of its predominance; </li>
<li>(b) The lot number; </li>
<li>(c) The following information for each vegetable seed named on the label:

*   (i) The percentage of germination exclusive of hard seed; 
*   (ii) The percentage of hard seed, if present.

**907.04 - Record maintenance.**

(A) Any person who holds a valid seed labeler permit issued under section [907.13](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.13) of the Revised Code and who sells agricultural, vegetable, or flower seed shall, for a period of eighteen months from the date of the final sale or other final disposition made, keep complete records of each lot of agricultural, vegetable, or flower seed that the person sells. If purchases are made from persons who keep records available for inspection as required under this division, the keeping for eighteen months of an invoice of each purchase and sale stating the kind of seed and the lot number meets the requirement as to records. The invoices and other records that are required to be kept under this division shall be maintained at a location in this state.

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>(A) The department of agriculture has sole and exclusive authority to regulate the registration, labeling, sale, storage, transportation, distribution, notification of use, use, and planting of seed within the state. The regulation of seed is a matter of general statewide interest that requires uniform statewide regulation, and this chapter and rules adopted under it constitute a comprehensive plan with respect to all aspects of the regulation of seed within this state.</li>
<li>(B) No political subdivision shall do any of the following:

*   (1) Regulate the registration, labeling, sale, storage, transportation, distribution, notification of use, use, or planting of seed;
*   (2) Require a person who has been issued a permit or license under this chapter to obtain a permit or license to operate in a manner described in this chapter or to satisfy any other condition except as provided by a statute or rule of this state or of the United States;
*   (3) Require a person who has registered a legume innoculant under this chapter to register that innoculant in a manner described in this chapter or to satisfy any other condition except as provided by a statute or rule of this state or of the United States.
</ul style="list-style: none;">

*   (C) No political subdivision shall enact, adopt, or continue in effect local legislation relating to the permitting or licensure of any person who is required to obtain a permit or license under this chapter or to the registration, labeling, sale, storage, transportation, distribution, notification of use, use, or planting of seed.
*   (D) As used in this section, "political subdivision" and "local legislation" have the same meanings as in section 905.503 of the Revised Code.

*   **NOTES: Adopted in 2014, this amendment to the Ohio Seed Law restricts the ability of local governments to regulate seeds in any way. Similar legislation has passed in at least one other state to require that any seed regulation happen only at the state level.**

**907.13 - Seed inspection fee tags or labels.**

No person shall label agricultural, vegetable, or flower seed that is** intended for sale** in this state unless the person holds a valid seed labeler permit that has been issued by the director of agriculture in accordance with this section.

A person who wishes to obtain a seed labeler permit shall file an application with the director on a form that the director provides and shall submit a permit fee in the amount of ten dollars. Such a person who labels seed under more than one name or at more than one address shall obtain a separate seed labeler permit and pay a separate permit fee for each name and address.

The applicant shall include the applicant's full name and address on the application together with any additional information that the director requires by rules adopted under section  [907.10](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.10) of the Revised Code. If the applicant's address is not within this state or it does not represent a location in this state where the director can collect samples of the applicant's seed for analysis, then the applicant shall include on the application an address within this state where samples of the applicant's seed may be collected for those purposes or shall agree to provide the director or the director's authorized representative with seeds for sampling upon request.

Upon receipt of a complete application accompanied by the ten-dollar permit fee, the director shall issue a seed labeler's permit to the applicant. All seed labeler permits that are issued under this section shall expire on the thirty-first day of December of each year regardless of the date on which a permit was issued during that year. 

Each person who obtains a seed labeler permit shall label the seed that the person intends for sale in this state in accordance with the requirements established in sections [907.01](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.01) to [907.17](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.17) of the Revised Code. Each person who holds a valid seed labeler permit shall keep the permit posted in a conspicuous place in the principal seed room from which the person sells seed and shall comply with the reporting and fee requirements that are established in section  [907.14](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.14) of the Revised Code. 

All money collected under this section shall be credited to the commercial feed and seed fund created in section [923.46](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/923.46) of the Revised Code.

*   **NOTES: Anybody who labels seed for sale needs to get a labeler's permit. The cost of the permit (as of Feb. 2015) is $10 annually, along with semi-annual fees based on how much seed is "sold." If giving seed away is interpreted as "selling" seed, this could mean that seed libraries and seed swappers might have to pay not only the $10 annual fee, but also the semi-annual fees based on how much seed they distribute to the community.**

**907.99 - Penalty.**

Whoever violates sections [907.01](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.01) to [907.17](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.17) , [907.27](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.27) to [907.35](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.35) , or [907.41](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.41) to [907.47](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/907.47) of the Revised Code is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on a first offense; on each subsequent offense such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

*   **NOTES: Violation of the seed law results in a fourth degree misdemeanor!**
