# Rhode Island Seed Law

[Statutes & Regulations](http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/bnatres/agricult/promotion.php )

**<u>Summary</u>**

*   The Rhode Island Seed Law does not state what it means to sell seeds and does not state whether it prohibits or allows "giving away" seeds. It is unclear whether seed sharing or giving activities would be covered by the state's seed law. 

**§2-6-2 Definitions.**

*   **(2) "Agricultural seed"** means the seeds of grass, forage, cereal, and fiber crops and other kinds of seeds commonly recognized within this state as agricultural seeds, lawn seeds and mixtures of those seeds, and may include noxious weed seeds when the director determines that the seed is being used as agricultural seed.

*   **Note: This definition of "agricultural seed" is circular and needs greater clarification. **

*   **(12) "Prohibited noxious weed seeds"** means the seeds of perennial weeds that not only reproduce by seed but also spread by underground roots, stems and other reproductive parts, and which, when well established, are highly destructive and difficult to control in this state by ordinary good cultural practice.
*   **(13) "Pure Seed", "Germination",** and other seed labeling and testing terms in common usage shall be defined as in the Rules for Testing Seeds published by the Association of Official Seed Analysts, effective July 1, 1955 and as subsequently amended.
*   **(15) "Restricted noxious weed seeds"** means the seeds of weeds that are objectionable in fields, lawns, and gardens of this state, but can be controlled by good cultural practices.
*   **(21) "Vegetable seeds"** means the seeds of those crops which are grown in gardens and on truck farms and are generally known and sold under the name of vegetable seeds in this state
*   **(22) "Weed seeds" **means the seeds of all plants generally recognized as weeds within this state and includes noxious weed seeds. 
*   **(10) "Person"** means any individual, partnership, corporation, company, society, or association.

**§2-6-4 Prohibitions. **

Details unlawful actions by a person **<u>to sell, offer for sale,</u> <u>expose for sale</u>**, or **<u>transport for sale</u>** any agricultural or vegetable seed within this state.

*   **Note: Rhode Island can exempt seed libraries from these prohibitions by clearly defining "sell" or "sold" in a way that excludes seed library activities. **

**§2-6-6 Exemptions.**

**Good faith sellers. – **(a) The provisions of §§ 2-6-3 and 2-6-4 do not apply:
