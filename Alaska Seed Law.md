# Alaska Seed Law

[Text of the Alaska Seed Rule](http://www.plants.alaska.gov/pdf/SOA-seed-regs.pdf)

## Summary

Alaska does not have a specific seed law. Chapter 03.05 of Alaska's general statutes provides that the Commissioner of Natural Resources "**shall regulate and control the entry into the state and the transportation, sale, or use inside the state of **plants, **seeds**, vegetables, shell eggs, fruits and berries, nursery stock, animal feeds, remedies and mineral supplements, fertilizers, and agricultural chemicals in order to prevent the spread of pests, diseases, or toxic substances injurious to the public interest, **and to protect the agricultural industry against fraud, deception, and misrepresentation**; in this connection the commissioner may require registration, inspection, and testing, and establish procedures and fees."

Alaska's administrative codes define the requirements for selling, labeling, and testing seed within the state. The sections requiring labeling and germination testing seem only to apply to seed that is sold, offered for sale, or transported within the state. The rules define "commercial production" broadly that might be interpereted to restrict noncommercial seed sharing. Otherwise, seed sharing should not be included in any interpretation of these codes.
