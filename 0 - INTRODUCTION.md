# Seed-Law-Tool-Shed
This is a publicly crowdsourced database of state seed laws in the United States, last updated in May, 2016. While the information and links here may be outdated, this is a resource for anyone interested in starting research into the legal requirements for selling or otherwise distributing seeds in a specific state.

This database was developed by the Sustainable Economies Law Center, in partnership with several community members, law students, and volunteers. We appreciate the time and effort these folks contributed to create this resource.
