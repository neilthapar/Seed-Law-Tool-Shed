1.  Seed for sowing purposes shall be labeled as follows:

*   a_._  Agricultural or vegetable seed that is treated, inoculated, or coated shall contain a word or statement indicating that the treatment, inoculation, or coating has been done.  A separate label may be used.
*   b_._  If treated, the label shall indicate the commonly accepted chemical or abbreviated chemical name of the applied substance or substances or a description of the type and purpose of procedure used.

Tests for labeling shall be as provided in section 199.10.

**199.8 - Prohibited Acts**

1.  It is unlawful for a person to sell, transport, offer for sale, expose for sale, or advertise an agricultural or vegetable seed:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>a.  Unless the test to determine the percentage of germination as required by this chapter has been completed within nine months, excluding the month of the test, immediately prior to selling, transporting, offering, exposing, or advertising for sale.  A retest is not required for seed in hermetically sealed containers or packages provided they have not reached the thirty-six month expiration date.</li>
<li>b.  Not labeled in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or having a false or misleading label.</li>
<li>c.  For which there has been false or misleading advertising.</li>
<li>d.  Consisting of or containing primary noxious weed seed, subject to recognized tolerances.</li>
<li>e.  Consisting of or containing secondary noxious weed seed per weight unit in excess of the number prescribed by rules adopted under this chapter, or in excess of the number declared on the label attached to the container of the seed or associated with the seed.</li>
<li>f.  Containing more than one and one-half percent by weight of all weed seed.</li>
<li>g.  If any labeling, advertising, or other representation subject to this chapter represents the seed to be certified seed or any class thereof, unless:

*   (1)  It has been determined by a seed certifying agency that the seed conforms to standards of varietal purity and identity as to kind in compliance with the rules and regulations of the agency.
*   (2)  The seed bears an official label issued for the seed by a seed certifying agency stating that the seed is of a specified class and a specified kind or variety.
</ul style="list-style: none;">

*   h.  Labeled with a variety name but not certified by an official seed certifying agency when it is a variety for which a United States certificate of plant variety protection under the Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2321 et. seq., specifies sale only as a class of certified seed.  Seed from a certified lot may be labeled as to variety name and used in a blend, by or with the approval of the owner of the variety.

2.  It is unlawful for a person to:

*   a.  Detach, alter, deface, or destroy a label provided for in this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter, or to alter or substitute seed in a manner that may defeat the purpose of this chapter.

*   c.  Hinder or obstruct in any way an authorized person in the performance of duties under this chapter.
*   d.  Fail to comply with a "stop sale" order or to move or otherwise handle or dispose of any lot of seed held under a “stop sale" order or tags attached thereto, except with express permission of the enforcing officer, and for the purpose specified thereby.
*   e.  Use the word "trace" as a substitute for any statement which is required.
*   f.  Use the word "type" in labeling in connection with the name of an agricultural seed variety.

3.  It is unlawful for a person to sell, transport, offer for sale, expose for sale, or advertise screenings of any agricultural seed subject to this chapter, unless it is stated on the label if in containers or on the invoice if in bulk, that they are not intended for seeding purposes.  For the purpose of this subsection, "screenings" includes chaff, empty florets, immature seed, weed seed, inert matter, and other materials removed by cleaning from any agricultural seed subject to this chapter.  

**199.9 - Exemptions**

1.  Sections 199.3 and 199.8 do not apply to:

*   _a._  Seed or grain not intended for sowing purposes.
*   _b._  Seed in storage in, or consigned to, or for sale to, a seed cleaning or conditioning establishment for cleaning or conditioning; provided that any labeling or other representation which is made with respect to the unclean or unconditioned seed is subject to this chapter.
*   _c._  A carrier in respect to seed transported or delivered for transportation in the ordinary course of its business as a carrier provided that the carrier is not engaged in producing, conditioning, or marketing seed, and subject to this chapter.

2.  A person is not subject to the penalties of this chapter for having sold, offered or exposed for sale in this state anyagricultural seeds which were incorrectly labeled or represented as to kind, species, variety, or origin when those seeds cannot be identified by examination, unless the person has failed to obtain an invoice or genuine grower's declaration or other labeling information and to take other precautions as reasonable to ensure the identity. A genuine grower's declaration of variety shall affirm that the grower holds records of proof concerning parent seed such as invoices and labels.

**199.10  TESTING METHODS -- COOPERATION OF FACILITIES.**

1.  _Testing methods when seed is for sale._  Seed lots of all kinds of agricultural seed intended for sale in this state shall be tested in accordance with the association of official seed analysts' rules for testing seed or the regulations under the federal Seed Act. The tests required shall be:

*   _a._  Purity analysis.
*   _b._  Noxious weed examination.
*   _c._  Germination.

2.  _Charges for testing._  Charges for seed testing by the Iowa state university or department of agriculture and land stewardship seed laboratory shall be determined by the Iowa state university laboratory.  Separate fee schedules shall be published for:

*   _a._  Tests for seed dealers, permit holders, and farmers who plan to sell seed.
*   _b._  Tests for out-of-state persons.

3.  _Cooperation between the Iowa state university and the department of agriculture and land stewardship._  To furnish farmers and seed dealers with information as to seed quality and guide them in the proper labeling of seed for sale, these organizations shall:

*   _a._  Integrate seed testing so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of personnel and equipment.  The department of agriculture and land stewardship seed laboratory shall be primarily concerned with seed testing for seed law enforcement purposes.  The Iowa state university seed laboratory shall promote seed education and research and shall conduct service testing for farmers and seed dealers.
*   _b._  Exchange information which will be mutually beneficial to both agencies in matters pertaining to agricultural seed.
*   _c._  Guide seed testing by all individuals or organizations so as to promote uniformity of seed testing in Iowa.

**199.15  PERMIT -- FEE -- FRAUD.**

1.  A person shall not sell, distribute, advertise, solicit orders for, offer or expose for sale, agricultural or vegetable seed without first obtaining from the department a permit to engage in the business.  A permit is not required of persons selling seeds which have been packed and distributed by a person holding and having in force a permit.  A permit is not required of persons selling or advertising seed of their own production, provided that the seed is stored or delivered to a purchaser only on or from the farm or premises where grown.

2. _a._  The fee for a new permit is ten dollars and the fee for a renewed permit is based on the gross annual sales of seeds in Iowa during the previous twelve-month period under the permit holder's label and all permits expire on the first day of July following date of issue.
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>_b._  Permits shall be issued subject to the following fee schedule:</li>
<li>

*   Gross sales of seeds                                            Fee
*   Not more than $ 25,000                                      $30
*   Over $25,000 but not exceeding 50,000            60
*   Over $50,000 but not exceeding 100,000           90
*   Over $100,000 but not exceeding 200,000        120
</ul style="list-style: none;">

**   _c._  For each additional increment of one hundred thousand dollars of sales in Iowa the fee shall increase by thirty dollars. The fee shall not exceed one thousand five hundred dollars for a permit holder.

3.  After due notice given at least ten days prior to a date of hearing fixed by the secretary, the department may revoke or refuse to renew a permit issued under this section if a violation of this chapter or if intent to defraud is established.  The failure to fulfill a contract to repurchase the seed crop produced from any agricultural seed, if the crop meets the requirements set forth in the contract and the standards specified in this chapter, is prima facie evidence of intent to defraud the purchaser at the time of entering into the contract.  However, this does not apply when seed stock is furnished by the contractor to the grower at no cost.
