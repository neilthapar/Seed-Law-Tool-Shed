# About the Seed Law Tool Shed

This is a collaborative space to compile information about state seed laws, particularly to examine how they apply to seed libraries.

**How to contribute to the Seed Law Tool Shed:**

1.  **Find your state:** Look at the list of states below and select the state you would like to contribute to.
2.  **Add links to the state statutes and regulations on seeds: **Also give the specific sections of code (i.e. Section 7104 of...), since links quickly become outdated. 
3.  **Copy and paste in provisions that you find to be particularly relevant: **In particular, paragraphs that define who must comply with the law, relevant definitions, and relevant exemptions.
4.  **Comment and ask questions: **Add notes on how you think the law might be interpreted, ask questions, and leave notes on areas for further research.
5.  **Read this disclaimer: **Neither Janelle Orsi, nor Shareable, nor the Sustainable Economies Law Center, nor anyone else posting on this Hackpad can be sure that this information is correct and up to date!  We did not do germination testing, vigor testing, accelerated aging testing, or anything else to ensure that this is good law.
