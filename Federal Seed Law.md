Good case for understanding the distinction between saving seed for re-planting and growing a seed-crop. Also discusses the "brown bag exemption" for casual sale of saved seeds.

An older case with an interesting limitation on the purpose of the federal seed law "The basic philosophy of the Federal Seed Act is to inform the user of what he is buying and to protect him against adulteration. The burden of knowing what is for sale and telling the truth about it is placed on the distributor, under the Act because he is presumed to have the better facilities for ascertaining the facts. (H.R. Rep. No. 538, 76th Cong. 1st Sess., pp. 2 and 3). The Act must be construed and applied in the light of its purpose."  <u>E.K. Hardison Seed Co. v. Jones</u>, 149 F.2d 252, 256 (6th Cir. 1945)
