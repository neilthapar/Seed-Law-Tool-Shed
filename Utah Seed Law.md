[Utah Seed Act ](http://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title4/Chapter16/4-16-S5.html)

## Summary

Utah's Labeling requirements apply to any seed "**offered or exposed for sale or transported for sowing**" which it's germination reqiurement specify that it applies to any seed "**offered or exposed for sale or for sowing." **It is ambiguous if seed sharing and seed libraries falls under the labeling requirements, but appear to fall under the germination requirements. One part of Utah Seed Law which bans Noxious Weed Seeds  (**R68-8-2)** explicitly uses the word "distribute."
